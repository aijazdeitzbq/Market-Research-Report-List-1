<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Gas Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li><li>Dry Scrubbers</li><li>Membrane Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The exhaust gas scrubber market comprises various types designed to reduce pollutants from marine engines. Open loop scrubbers use seawater to neutralize emissions but are limited by local regulations. Closed loop scrubbers recirculate fresh water mixed with chemicals for effective treatment, suitable for all waters. Hybrid scrubbers can operate in both modes. Dry scrubbers employ solid materials to capture pollutants, while membrane scrubbers use selective membranes to separate harmful gases. Each type offers distinct advantages based on operational requirements and environmental regulations.</p></p>
