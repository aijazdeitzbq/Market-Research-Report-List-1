<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Thinner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photo Resist</li><li>Negative Photo Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist thinner market is primarily divided into two types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes soluble when exposed to light, allowing the unexposed areas to be washed away, resulting in a precise pattern. Conversely, negative photoresist hardens upon exposure, making the exposed areas insoluble, which retains the desired pattern after development. Both types are essential in photolithography processes used in semiconductor manufacturing and microfabrication, with varying applications based on their chemical properties and fabrication requirements.</p></p>
